# Flatiron School Final Project - RaPool

## Description

This project allows users to host their own raffles and also participate in raffles hosted by other users. The prizes will be an Amazon product(linked to Amazon API) of the host's choice and will be crowd-funded by the raffle participants. RaPool offers a unique mechanism that collects funds surpassing the funds required to fund the product(prize) and donates the funds under the name of all raffle participants. Once a raffle is fully funded of the product price, a 24-hour countdown will automatically be initiated - any additional shares bought by participants will be contributed towards funding the donation, but will still earn you the same chance(per $) of winning the raffle.
